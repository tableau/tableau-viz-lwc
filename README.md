In the spirit of innovation, we're delighted to announce a major update to the Tableau LWC. With the recent Spring '24 release, we've unveiled a native version of the [Tableau _View_ LWC](https://help.tableau.com/current/online/en-us/lwc_seamless_auth.htm) to seamlessly integrate Tableau within the Salesforce ecosystem. The native Tableau _View_ LWC will replace the open-source Tableau _Viz_ LWC.

**What's New:**

The native Tableau View LWC brings a host of exciting features and optimizations, promising a more intuitive and integrated experience. This strategic enhancement is designed to elevate your workflow and empower you to create even more powerful and impactful solutions.

**Migration to Native LWC:**

To align with this exciting evolution, we've made the strategic decision to discontinue support for the open-source LWC version. As a result, we will no longer support the Tableau _Viz_ LWC. Over the coming weeks we will address and close open Issues.

**Next Steps:**

-   We encourage you to dive into the possibilities offered by the new native [Tableau _View_ LWC](https://help.tableau.com/current/online/en-us/lwc_seamless_auth.htm).
-   Should you encounter any challenges or if the issue persists, please feel free to file a bug report. We're committed to providing you with the support you need in this transformative phase.

Thank you for being part of this exciting chapter in Tableau's journey.
